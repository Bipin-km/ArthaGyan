      <p>
        A credit score is a numerical representation of a person’s
        creditworthiness. Banks and financial institutions use it to evaluate
        the likelihood of a borrower repaying a loan. Credit scores typically
        range from 300 to 850, with higher scores indicating better credit
        health.
